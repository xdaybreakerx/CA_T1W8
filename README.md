# Tuesday class:
- discussed Object Oriented Programming
    - software design using objects rather than functions and logics
    - each object has:
        - attributes (properties)
        - methods (behaviour)
- pillars of OOP:
    - encapsulation (data and information hiding, and only selected info is exposed)
    - inheritance (reuse code from other classes - parent-child relationship)
    - polymorphism (have many forms)
    - abstraction (hiding implementation - using abstract class and interface)
- Discussed basic file handling
